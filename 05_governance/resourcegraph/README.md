# Azure Resource Graph quickstart queries

This repo contains all currently available Azure Resource Graph queries contributed by ShareGate and the community.

## About source code in this repository
* Query code goes under the the right `queries` folder.
* Create a folder for the service it concerns (i.g.: storageAccounts, cdn, virtualNetworks).
* Create a folder for your query (all lower case with dases instead of spaces).
* The query goes in a `query.txt` file.
* Create a README.md file to provide a title/description of what the query does.
* (On Windows) Run `Test-ResourceGraphQueries.ps1` to test the queries before creating a PR.
* You can place your query code in this repository by creating a PR.

## Requirements for CI of queries
